# Sales Analysis and Inventory Management Project

## Project Overview
This project combines Python data engineering with Excel analysis to create a comprehensive sales and inventory management solution.

## Workflow
1. **Data Engineering (Python)**: Cleaned and transformed raw sales data
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**: Initial data exploration and pattern identification  
3. **Detailed Analysis (Excel)**: Deep dive analysis using pivot tables and Excel formulas
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Visual representation of key metrics and insights

## Key Technologies
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and initial EDA
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Excel**: Used for in-depth analysis and dashboard creation
  - Features: Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, Data Visualization

## Key Findings

- **Q4 sales spikes** indicate strong end-of-year performance.
- **Consumer segment** drives 52% of sales but has the **lowest profit per order**.
- **Corporate customers** generate the **highest total and average profit**.
- **Central region** has the **highest loss-making orders**, needing intervention.
- **West region** has a **balanced profit distribution**, making it the most stable.
- **Furnishings and Chairs** have **steady profits**, while **Tables generate losses**.
- **Discounts above 20% significantly reduce profit margins** (-0.89 correlation).
- **Tables receive the highest discount (26%) but have the lowest profit ratios**.
- **Just-in-time procurement** is needed for Q1 and Q2 due to lower demand.
- **Flexible supplier contracts** are recommended to adjust stock by season.
- **Reducing aggressive discounts** on loss-making products can improve profits.
- **Stock levels should align with seasonal demand to avoid stockouts**.

## File Structure
- `/python_scripts/`: Contains data engineering and analysis scripts
- `/Original and Cleaned Data/`: Contains the data before and after the cleaning and engineering
- `/EDA/`: Contains a Jupyter notebook and Excel workbook for exploratory data analysis.
- `/outputs/`: Contains visualizations and reports generated

## How to Use This Repository
1. Review the Python scripts to understand the data cleaning process
2. Examine the Excel files to see the analysis methodology
3. Check the outputs folder for key visualizations and findings
